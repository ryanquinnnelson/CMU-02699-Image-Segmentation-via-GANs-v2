# CMU-02699-Image-Segmentation-via-GANs2
Spring 2022 Bioimage Informatics (Self-Study) project

This project explores using a deep generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform semi-supervised image segmentation on the 2015 MICCAI Gland Challenge dataset. This is an improvement over version 1, adding triplet loss and hard negative mining to the training process.
